    Socks Draws
 </b>
PrepBuddy is getting late for college. She is looking for a matching pair of socks from a drawer full of socks. In the worst-case scenario, how many socks should PrepBuddy remove from her drawer until she finds a matching pair.</p>

<p><b>Square Fit</b>
PrepBuddy provided you with a rectangular board of 
m
x
n
 dimension. Also, he provided an unlimited number of small blocks of 
2
x
1
 size. You are allowed to rotate the block. You are asked to place as many blocks as possible on the board to meet the following conditions:
1. Each block completely covers two squares.
2. No two blocks overlap.
3. Each block lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.
Find the maximum number of blocks, which can be placed under these restrictions.</p>

<p><b>Atom Combine</b>
    Atoms combine to form molecules. The base amount of atom 
=
1
 at 
s
e
c
=
1
 that is combined into the molecule, and for every second that passes, their base amount doubles. So at sec
=
2
, there are 
2
 atoms and now a total of 
3
 (previous 
1
 + 
2
(new)) atoms are present in the molecule. At sec
=
3
, there are 
4
 atoms, and now the total is 
7
 (previous 
3

<p><b>Divisibility Test</b>
O
M
G
!
 You made up this question, Congrats on that
!
 Let us solve a fun maths question now. Just do the simple calculation behind it and you are done. You are given a number 
n
 and you are asked to make 
n
 divisible by 
10
. The only operation you can do on 
n
 is to multiply 
n
 by 
2
.
Given 
n
 find out how many operations are required to make 
n
 divisible by 
10
.

Note: You have to complete DivTest function. No need to take any input.</p>
